# Zorohack

Zorohack is a project to eliminate and discard the triggers while browsing that cause people to relapse back to addiction.

## What led to this?

A person who is trying to stop using drugs can make mistakes, feel bad and start using again. This return to addiction is called a relaspse. Studies reflect that 40% - 60% of individuals relaspse within 30 days of de-addiction, and upto 85 in a year. It is important for individuals who struggle with addiction to acknowledge the higher risk of relapse and have an awareness of what their triggers are. In the present situation where the pandemic causes a lot of citizens to stay at home, people have spent a lot of time browsing and are likely to find triggers that cause them to relapse. Zorohack solve this problem by censoring each and every word and image which may lead to such a trigger.
